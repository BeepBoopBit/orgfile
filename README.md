# OrgFile

A simple python code for automatically organizing your messy files into different folders. I mainly use this program to organize my file in my Downloads Folder since it can become very messy.

# Installation (Linux)

1. Download and Extract `orgfile` to a directory
2. Enter in your terminal `cd ~`
3. Enter in your terminal `mkdir -p bashes/scripts/py` (if it still doesn't exists)
4. Paste the `orgfile` inside the `bashes` folder
5. Paste the `orgfile.py` inside the `bashes/scripts/py` folder.
6. Enter in your terminal `echo "export PATH=$PATH:~bashes" >> ~/.bashrc`


# Usage

1. Go to your messy folder
2. type `orgfile`
